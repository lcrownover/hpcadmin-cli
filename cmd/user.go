There are three role a user can serve for a PIRG:
1. PI: This is the person who is responsible for the project, and the owner of the PIRG.
2. Admin: This is the person who is capable of the day-to-day management of the PIRG.
3. Member: This is the person who is a member of the PIRG, and has access to the PIRG's resources.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// userCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// userCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
